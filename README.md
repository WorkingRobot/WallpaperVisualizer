### About
This project is a wallpaper background for Windows computers. Running on OpenGL, it creates a real-time graph of the current audio coming from your speakers. Planned features are to add Spotify support, show the colors on your taskbar, and disable the main graph when a window is fullscreened or maximized.
### Installation
All you have to do is download the executable and run it. It will create a JSON configuration for you in the current directory. It runs with default settings on the first run, and notifies you if a setting is incorrect or invalid.
### To-Do

 - Add Spotify support
 - Set window to wallpaper
 - Add taskbar colors
 - Disable main graph when a window is maximized or fullscreened
 - Add configuration
